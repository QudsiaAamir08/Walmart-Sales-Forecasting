# Walmart-Sales-Forecasting
 "Developed a time series forecasting model to predict Walmartâ€™s weekly store sales using regression techniques, feature engineering, and trend analysis. Implemented data preprocessing, lag features, and visualizations to uncover seasonality and improve prediction accuracy."
his machine learning project predicts weekly sales for Walmart stores using regression models based on historical sales data. The pipeline includes:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Feature engineering (lag features, rolling averages, date-based features)

Handling missing values and outliers

Model training using Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor

Performance evaluation with MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² score

Visualization of trends, store-wise sales, seasonality, and actual vs predicted performance

Tools & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

ðŸ“Š This project was developed as part of a hands-on learning exercise in time series forecasting.

Agar tum chaho to main iske saath professional-style visuals aur final notebook flow bhi design kar dunga taki description ke saath output bhi impressive lage.
